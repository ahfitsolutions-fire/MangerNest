      <h1>About MangerNest</h1>

      <p>
        MangerNest was inspired by the humility of Luke 2, where the Savior
        entered the world not in luxury, but in love.
      </p>

      <p>
        We design baby beds and clothing using natural materials, gentle fabrics,
        and ethical craftsmanship.
      </p>

      <p>
        God is the owner of this work. We are only stewards.
